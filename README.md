 # Coding Curves in Swift
 
Keith Peters, on his blog at [BIT-101](https://www.bit-101.com/blog/) is publicly writing a book called [Coding Curves](https://www.bit-101.com/blog/2022/11/coding-curves/) as a series of blog posts. His book is about many fascinating curves that are fun to code and create interesting images.
 
This Swift playground is my implementation of the pseudocode presented in that blog. I did this to experience the fun Keith Peters said I would have. I followed along with the the blog posts, and implemented a version of the code. I did not give much thought to optimizing this code. I don't claim this is the best way to implement these curves. Just that I was able to produce the expected results when running this playground locally.
